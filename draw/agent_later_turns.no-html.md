Attached is the rendered image in the last turn.

Please inspect the user instruction carefully. Do you believe the visualization is **comprehensive** enough to cover all user instructions, and there isn't any missing information you'll need to annotate?

Start your response with YES or NO. If you answer begins with YES, then this will be your last turn. If you believe you need more turns, then begin your answer with NO, then write more code to go ahead with your annotations. You should use the same figure and axes as in the last turn - DO NOT create new figures. You can also refer to the same variables.
