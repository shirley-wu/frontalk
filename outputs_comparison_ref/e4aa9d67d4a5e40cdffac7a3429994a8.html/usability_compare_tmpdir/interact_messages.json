Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page \u2014 including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change \u2014 you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first \u2014 just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons \u2014 do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first \u2014 just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"

Here's an overview of my experience:\n\n1. **Navigation and Structure**: The homepage provides a clear navigation menu with options for \"Event Calendar,\" \"Virtual Campus Tour,\" \"Alumni Network Portal,\" \"News and Updates,\" and \"Faculty Profiles.\" However, it lacks a direct link to academic programs, which would be valuable for prospective students.\n\n2. **Content Accessibility**: The \"Virtual Campus Tour\" page was not functional due to browser compatibility issues with the video tag. This is a significant drawback as it limits access to potentially important visual content about the campus.\n\n3. **Search Functionality**: The search feature on the \"News and Updates\" page did not yield visible results, indicating possible issues with the search implementation or lack of content for the query used.\n\n4. **Faculty Profiles**: The \"Faculty Profiles\" section was informative, allowing filtering by department. This feature is helpful for users interested in specific academic departments, providing insight into faculty expertise and associated programs.\n\n5. **Overall Usability**: The website's structure is straightforward, but the lack of direct access to key information, such as academic programs and a non-functional virtual tour, hinders the user experience. Improving content accessibility and functionality would enhance the website's effectiveness as a promotional tool for prospective students.\n\nEnhancements such as fixing the video compatibility issue, ensuring the search function works effectively, and adding a dedicated academic programs section would significantly improve the usability and user experience of the site."
