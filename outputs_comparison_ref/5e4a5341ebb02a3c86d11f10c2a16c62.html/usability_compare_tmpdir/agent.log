INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Usability Summary:\n\nThe website for Bozeman Local News & Radio provides a straightforward layout with sections for live radio, local news, events, and community engagement. However, several usability issues were encountered:\n\n1. **Non-Functional Elements:** Key features such as "Listen Live" and "Play" for radio streaming did not respond to clicks, which could be frustrating for users looking to access live radio content.\n\n2. **Lack of Interactive Content:** Sections like "Submit News Tips," "Provide Feedback," and "Enter Contests" did not have visible forms or interactive elements, making it unclear how users can participate or engage with the site.\n\n3. **Navigation and Feedback:** Clicking certain elements like "Vote" in the feedback section did not provide any visible feedback or changes, which may confuse users regarding the success of their actions.\n\n4. **Content Exploration:** While sections for news categories (e.g., Sports, Politics, Weather) and events are present, they did not lead to detailed articles or further information when explored.\n\nOverall, the website presents its content categories clearly but lacks functional interactivity and feedback, which are crucial for user engagement and satisfaction. Improvements could include ensuring all clickable elements are functional, providing feedback after actions, and enabling interactive forms for user contributions.'}
