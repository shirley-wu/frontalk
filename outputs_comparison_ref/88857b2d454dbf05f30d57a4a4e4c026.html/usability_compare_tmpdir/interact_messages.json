Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page \u2014 including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change \u2014 you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first \u2014 just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons \u2014 do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first \u2014 just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"

However, the usability of the site is hindered by several issues:\n\n1. **Navigation Challenges**: \n   - The homepage offers buttons for exploring music reviews and upcoming events, but clicking these often leads to pages with non-functional elements or no feedback, such as the filter input fields on the music review page.\n\n2. **Broken Links**: \n   - Many links, such as \"Learn More\" for events and \"Contact Us,\" result in error pages, indicating broken or missing content. This significantly disrupts the user experience as users cannot access detailed information or contact the site for assistance.\n\n3. **Limited Feedback**: \n   - Actions like filtering reviews or subscribing to updates do not provide clear feedback or confirmation, making it difficult for users to know if their actions have been successful.\n\n4. **Social Media Links**: \n   - Clicking social media icons like Facebook does not redirect to the expected pages, suggesting these links may also be broken or improperly configured.\n\nOverall, the website's usability is currently poor due to broken links and lack of interactive feedback. To improve, the site should ensure all links are functional, provide clear feedback for user actions, and fix any navigation issues to enhance the user experience."
