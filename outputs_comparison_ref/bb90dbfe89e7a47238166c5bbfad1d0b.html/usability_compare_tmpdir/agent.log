INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Summary: As a first-time user exploring the American History Explorer website, the experience was limited in terms of usability and content accessibility. The website features three main sections: an Interactive Timeline, a Quiz Section, and a Multimedia Gallery. However, each section had significant usability issues:\n\n1. **Interactive Timeline**: This section did not provide any interactive elements or additional content beyond the initial page, making it difficult to access historical information.\n\n2. **Quiz Section**: Although the quiz presented a question about American presidents, selecting an answer did not result in any feedback or progression, which hinders the learning experience. The Leaderboard displayed scores, but without functional quizzes, it served little purpose.\n\n3. **Multimedia Gallery**: The gallery offered options for Images, Videos, and Audio, but none of these buttons resulted in displaying any content, suggesting a lack of available resources or functionality.\n\nOverall, the website's current state does not fulfill its educational goal effectively, as it lacks interactive and accessible content for students and children to learn about significant historical events and figures in American history. Improvements in functionality and content delivery are needed to enhance the user experience."}
