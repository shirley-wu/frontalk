Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page \u2014 including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change \u2014 you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first \u2014 just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons \u2014 do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first \u2014 just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"

However, during my exploration, I encountered several usability challenges:\n\n1. **Navigation and Content Accessibility**: The main navigation options (Forum, News, Statistics) are straightforward, but accessing detailed content within these sections was difficult. The forum and news sections lacked clickable or interactive elements, making it impossible to delve deeper into specific topics or threads.\n\n2. **Search Functionality**: The search functionality in the forum did not yield results, suggesting either a lack of content or a non-functional search feature, which can be frustrating for users looking for specific discussions.\n\n3. **Data Visualization**: In the Statistics section, although dropdowns allowed for the selection of time periods and regions, the content remained as placeholders. This absence of real data or visualization hinders the user's ability to analyze economic trends effectively.\n\n4. **Overall Usability**: The website's current state, with many placeholders and non-interactive elements, significantly limits its usability. Users seeking to explore global economic issues or engage in discussions would find it challenging to achieve their goals due to the lack of accessible content and interactive features.\n\nIn conclusion, while the site structure is clear, the actual usability is compromised by the absence of functional content and interactive elements, which are critical for fulfilling the website's high-level goal of exploring and discussing global economic issues."
