        <p>As Thanksgiving approaches, we invite you to join us for a special Thanksgiving service. This will be a time to reflect on the blessings we have received and to express our gratitude to God. The service will include music, prayer, and a message of thankfulness. We look forward to celebrating this season of gratitude with you and your family.</p>
