    "content": "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page \u2014 including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change \u2014 you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first \u2014 just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons \u2014 do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first \u2014 just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"

However, the usability of the site is hindered by several issues:\n\n1. **Live Section**: Attempting to access live broadcasts resulted in a message indicating video playback issues (\"Your browser does not support the video tag\"). This suggests either a technical problem or a lack of compatibility with the browser used.\n\n2. **Weather Section**: The site provides detailed weather forecasts and an interactive radar feature. However, clicking options like \"Precipitation\" and \"Satellite\" did not result in visible changes, indicating potential functionality issues.\n\n3. **Subscription Process**: The newsletter subscription form allows users to enter an email address, but clicking \"Subscribe\" did not provide any confirmation or feedback, leaving users uncertain if their submission was successful.\n\nOverall, while the site has the potential to offer valuable content, its usability is significantly affected by non-functional elements and a lack of user feedback, which can lead to user frustration and confusion. Improvements in interactive features and clearer feedback mechanisms are needed to enhance the user experience."
