INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The Artistry Market website provides a basic framework for an art marketplace, with features for searching artworks and managing a wishlist. As a first-time user, the site is relatively straightforward to navigate, with a simple layout that includes a search bar, wishlist, and basic navigation buttons. However, there are several usability concerns:\n\n1. **Search Functionality**: The search feature is limited, as it consistently returns the same artwork regardless of the search term used. This suggests that the feature might not be fully implemented or is using placeholder content.\n\n2. **Wishlist Management**: The wishlist feature allows adding and attempting to remove items, but the removal function did not visibly update the page, indicating a possible issue with this functionality.\n\n3. **Navigation**: The navigation buttons ("‹" and "›") did not change the content or appear to function as expected, suggesting they might be placeholders or inactive.\n\n4. **Content Diversity**: The site currently lacks diversity in its displayed content, with only one artwork consistently shown. This limits the user\'s ability to explore and browse a variety of artworks or categories.\n\nOverall, while the website\'s current features are easy to understand and use, they are limited in functionality and content diversity, which impacts the overall user experience. For improved usability, the website would benefit from fully implementing search and wishlist functionalities, enabling navigation buttons, and diversifying the displayed content.'}
