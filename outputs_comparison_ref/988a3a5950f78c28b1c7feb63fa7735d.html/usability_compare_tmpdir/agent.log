INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Summary: The Kentucky Kindred Genealogy website offers a range of features focused on genealogical research and historical data related to Kentucky. The main navigation is straightforward, with sections dedicated to genealogical records, a family tree builder, and a community forum. However, several usability issues were encountered during the exploration:\n\n1. **Filtering and Sorting**: The filtering function for genealogical records did not seem to work effectively, as selecting "Marriage Certificates" did not update the displayed records accordingly. Sorting options also did not visibly change the order of records.\n\n2. **Family Tree Builder**: Actions such as adding family members and uploading documents did not provide any feedback or visible changes, leaving the user unsure if these actions were successful.\n\n3. **Community Forum**: Attempts to access discussions or posts within the forum categories and recent posts did not result in any content being displayed, suggesting either a lack of content or functionality issues.\n\n4. **Content Access**: Viewing featured family trees worked, providing information about notable family members. However, further actions like nominating a tree did not offer additional information or feedback.\n\nOverall, while the website\'s layout is intuitive, the lack of feedback and visible results from user interactions hampers the usability experience, potentially leading to user frustration. Improvements in functionality and user feedback mechanisms are needed to enhance the user experience.'}
