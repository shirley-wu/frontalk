INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Usability Summary:\n\nDuring my interaction with the e-commerce platform, I encountered several usability challenges that hindered the overall experience as a first-time user:\n\n1. **Search Functionality**: The search feature did not display any results for queries such as "laptop" and "computer accessories." Despite entering valid search terms and clicking the search button, the page content remained unchanged, suggesting a malfunction or ineffective display of search results.\n\n2. **Navigation and Product Discovery**: The website lacked clear navigation options or visible categories for exploring products. The homepage primarily displayed a promotional section, and the "Top Sellers" area only showcased a single product. This limited my ability to browse or discover a range of electronic products effectively.\n\n3. **Limited Content Visibility**: The website did not provide any additional content or options upon scrolling, reinforcing the impression of limited functionality. This made it challenging to find and explore products, which is the primary goal of an e-commerce platform.\n\n4. **Support Features**: While the "Help & Support" section offered a contact form and FAQ, it did not contribute to product exploration or purchasing processes. These features are useful for customer support but do not address the main usability issues related to product discovery.\n\nOverall, the website requires improvements in search functionality, navigation, and product display to enhance user experience and fulfill its goal of selling electronic products. Without these enhancements, the platform remains difficult to use for first-time users seeking to explore and purchase items.'}
