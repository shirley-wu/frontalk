INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Summary: The website\'s primary goal is to assist users in finding and booking hotel accommodations. The initial interface is straightforward, featuring a single "Find Hotels Now" button that leads to a "Personalized Booking Assistant" page. This page includes fields for inputting budget, selecting preferred amenities, and setting travel dates. \n\nUsability Issues Encountered:\n1. **Date Input Challenges**: The travel date field, despite being a `date` type, did not respond as expected to direct typing or clicking, which typically should trigger a date picker. This led to repeated unsuccessful attempts to input a date.\n\n2. **Feedback and Guidance**: There was a lack of feedback or guidance when incorrect inputs were attempted, especially for the date field. Clearer error messages or instructions could improve user experience.\n\n3. **Navigation**: The "Back to Homepage" link functioned as expected, allowing for easy navigation back to the starting point.\n\nOverall, the website\'s usability could be enhanced by improving the date input process, providing clearer instructions or feedback when errors occur, and ensuring all interactive elements function as intended.'}
