INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Summary: The financial news platform provides several tools and features aimed at investors and financial market enthusiasts, including a Stock Comparison Tool, Market Trends, User Portfolio Tracker, and Stock Watchlist. The navigation between these sections is straightforward, with clear labels for each feature on the homepage.\n\nUsability Observations:\n1. **Stock Comparison Tool**: The tool displays financial metrics for companies, but lacks interactive elements for adding new comparisons or adjusting criteria, which could enhance user engagement and functionality.\n   \n2. **Market Trends**: The ability to filter data by time period and stock index is useful. However, the lack of visible updates or data display suggests a need for more dynamic content or clearer feedback on user actions.\n\n3. **User Portfolio Tracker**: Adding stocks and setting price alerts was intuitive, with clear input fields and buttons. However, the lack of visible feedback after actions (like adding a stock) could be improved to confirm successful operations to users.\n\nOverall, the website is user-friendly with a simple layout, but could benefit from more dynamic content updates and clearer action feedback to enhance the user experience.'}
