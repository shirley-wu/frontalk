INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page ‚Äî including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change ‚Äî you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first ‚Äî just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons ‚Äî do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first ‚Äî just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The "VNC Local News" website provides a straightforward interface with sections for featured news, trending topics, community events, and weather updates. The navigation bar is clear, but initial attempts to interact with it were unsuccessful, possibly due to a lack of response or incorrect labeling.\n\nThe "Community Events Calendar" was accessible and offered functionality to view upcoming events and submit new ones. The form for adding events was intuitive, with fields for event name, date, and description. However, the usability was hindered by the date input field, which required a specific interaction (date picker) that was not immediately obvious when typing directly into the field resulted in an error.\n\nOverall, the website offers relevant local content and useful features, but could improve in terms of interactive feedback and guidance, particularly with form inputs like date fields, to enhance user experience and prevent errors.'}
