INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Usability Summary:\n\nThe DebtWise website is designed to offer financial education and resources, particularly focusing on debt management. Here are some observations regarding its usability:\n\n1. **Navigation and Layout**: The homepage provides clear navigation options to sections like "Blog" and "Strategies," which are likely intended to offer educational content. The "Debt Assessment" feature is prominently displayed, indicating its importance as a primary tool for users.\n\n2. **Interactive Features**: The "Debt Assessment" form was straightforward to fill out, but the subsequent features like "Set Goals" and "View Progress" did not provide visible feedback or content, which might confuse users about their functionality.\n\n3. **Content Accessibility**: The blog section lists articles on financial topics, but clicking on them did not lead to new pages or display the article content. Similarly, filtering options and the search bar did not function as expected, limiting the user\'s ability to explore specific topics.\n\n4. **User Feedback**: The website often displayed pop-up messages that closed quickly, providing little feedback on user actions. Ensuring that users receive clear and persistent feedback for their interactions would improve the experience.\n\n5. **Overall Usability**: While the website\'s goal of providing financial education is clear, the limited functionality of interactive elements and the lack of accessible content hinder the user experience. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance usability, making it easier for users to navigate and benefit from the website\'s resources.'}
