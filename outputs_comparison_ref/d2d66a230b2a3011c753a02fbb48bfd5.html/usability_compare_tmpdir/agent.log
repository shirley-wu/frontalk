INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Summary: My experience with the Men\'s Health website involved exploring different sections, including personalized plans, finance tips, and premium content. The website\'s usability faced several challenges:\n\n1. **Personalized Plan**: The interface provided fields to input fitness goals and dietary preferences with a "Generate My Plan" button. However, clicking the button did not yield any visible results or feedback, suggesting a potential issue with the feature\'s functionality.\n\n2. **Finance Tips**: This section included a savings calculator, but similar to the personalized plan, the calculator did not update or display results after inputs were provided and the "Calculate" button was clicked. This lack of feedback can confuse users and hinder their ability to utilize the tool effectively.\n\n3. **Premium Content**: The section offered exclusive articles and videos, but access required a subscription. The "Subscribe Now" button did not lead to a subscription page or additional information, leaving the subscription process unclear.\n\n4. **General Navigation**: The layout was straightforward, with clear labels for each section. However, the lack of functional interactivity in key areas diminished the overall user experience.\n\nOverall, the site needs improvements in interactive elements to enhance usability and ensure that users can effectively engage with and benefit from the content and tools provided.'}
