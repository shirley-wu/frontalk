INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The website\'s usability for a first-time user aiming to access online guitar lessons is somewhat limited. Here\'s a summary of the experience:\n\n1. **Video Lessons**: The primary feature, video lessons for "Beginner Blues" and "Intermediate Rock," were not functional. The message "Your browser does not support the video tag" suggests a technical issue preventing video playback, which is a significant usability problem for a site focused on video tutorials.\n\n2. **Resource Library**: The Resource Library offered downloadable PDFs for chord charts and tablature, but these were placeholders. This indicates that while the structure for resources is present, the actual content is missing or not yet implemented, limiting the user\'s ability to learn from these materials.\n\n3. **Live Q&A Sessions**: This section provided a list of sessions with placeholders for dates and times. There was no further interaction available, such as signing up for sessions or viewing more details, which could improve user engagement.\n\n4. **Feedback Mechanism**: The feedback section on lesson pages was functional, allowing users to submit comments. However, there was no confirmation message upon submission, which could leave users unsure if their feedback was received.\n\n5. **Navigation and Layout**: The website\'s navigation was straightforward, with clear labels for different sections (lessons, Q&A, forum, resources). However, the lack of functional content in key areas like video lessons and resources detracts from the overall usability.\n\nOverall, the website has a clear layout and potentially useful features, but the lack of functional content in critical areas significantly impacts its usability for learning guitar. Improving video playback functionality and providing actual content in the Resource Library would enhance the user experience.'}
