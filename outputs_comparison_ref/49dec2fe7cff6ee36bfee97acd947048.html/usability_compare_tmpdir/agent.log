INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Summary:\n\nThe IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security website provides a structured layout with clear sections dedicated to various aspects of the conference, such as paper submission, conference schedule, registration, speaker profiles, networking events, and FAQs. However, there are several usability issues noted during the exploration:\n\n1. **Paper Submission:**\n   - The process of submitting a paper involves filling out multiple fields and uploading a document. However, after clicking the "Submit Paper" button, there was no visible confirmation or feedback, which can be confusing for users.\n\n2. **Conference Schedule:**\n   - The filtering feature for the conference schedule did not function as expected. Selecting filters such as "Keynotes" or a specific speaker did not update the display, which can hinder users from finding specific information quickly.\n\n3. **Registration & Ticketing:**\n   - The registration page appears to have input fields for personal details and workshop selection, followed by a "Checkout" button. However, without further exploration, it\'s unclear if the process provides adequate feedback or confirmation.\n\nOverall, while the website\'s navigation is straightforward, the lack of feedback in critical areas such as form submission and filtering could be improved to enhance user experience. Providing confirmation messages and ensuring filters work correctly would significantly improve usability.'}
