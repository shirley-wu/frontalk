INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "During my exploration of the website, which offers drainage and plumbing services, I encountered several usability challenges. Here's a summary of my experience:\n\n1. **Homepage Navigation**: The homepage provides clear options for booking a service, making an emergency call, and checking service areas. The layout is straightforward, with clearly labeled buttons, making it easy to navigate for a first-time user.\n\n2. **Service Area Check**: The service area functionality was straightforward in terms of displaying covered areas. However, when entering a postcode to check coverage, there was no feedback or confirmation, which is a significant usability issue. Users need confirmation to know if their area is serviced.\n\n3. **Booking a Service**: The process to book a service was hindered by form input issues. The layout initially seemed clear, with dropdowns for service type, date input, and contact information. However, attempts to submit the form were repeatedly unsuccessful due to a persistent error indicating an empty field, even when fields were populated correctly. This suggests a potential issue with form validation or input recognition.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The error messages were not informative enough to guide users on how to correct their input, which can lead to frustration and potential abandonment of the booking process.\n\nOverall, the website's usability is impacted by the lack of feedback in the service area check and the problematic form submission process. Improvements are needed in error handling, input validation, and user feedback to enhance the user experience and ensure that the site's services can be accessed easily by potential clients."}
