Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page \u2014 including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change \u2014 you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first \u2014 just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons \u2014 do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first \u2014 just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"

However, some interactions, such as clicking the \"Start Your Search\" button, did not lead to any visible change, which could be confusing for new users.\n\n2. **Search Functionality**: Despite typing a keyword into the search bar and clicking search, there was no visible feedback or results, indicating that this feature may not be functioning or is not intuitive to use.\n\n3. **Document Interaction**: The legal resource center lists documents with options to download or rate them. However, clicking the download button did not produce any noticeable feedback or action, suggesting that this feature might not be working or lacks visible confirmation.\n\n4. **Document Submission**: The submission process was straightforward, with fields for title, description, and category selection. However, submitting a document did not provide any confirmation or feedback, which can leave users unsure if their action was successful.\n\n5. **Feedback and Confirmation**: A significant area for improvement is providing feedback to users for their actions, such as successful searches, downloads, or submissions. This would greatly enhance user confidence and experience.\n\nOverall, while the site has a clear structure and intends to offer valuable legal resources, improving the functionality and feedback of key features would enhance its usability significantly."
