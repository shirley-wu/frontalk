INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

However, as a first-time user, navigating the site proved challenging due to several usability issues:\n\n1. **Non-Functional Buttons**: Several interactive elements, such as the "Learn More" and "Apply" buttons, did not lead to any further content or actions. This can be frustrating for users seeking detailed information or trying to engage with research opportunities.\n\n2. **Limited Content Visibility**: The "Publications" section displayed only a single entry, and the search functionality did not yield additional results. This could suggest a lack of content or a malfunction in the search feature.\n\n3. **Ineffective Tag Filtering**: In the "Blog" section, clicking on popular tags like "Genetics" and "Research" did not filter articles as expected, leaving the "Featured Articles" section empty. This might indicate a lack of tagged content or issues with the filtering system.\n\n4. **Navigation Challenges**: While the main navigation bar is straightforward, the lack of functional links and limited content in each section makes it difficult for users to engage with the website\'s offerings effectively.\n\nOverall, the site requires improvements in content accessibility and functionality to enhance the user experience and effectively showcase the research group\'s work.'}
