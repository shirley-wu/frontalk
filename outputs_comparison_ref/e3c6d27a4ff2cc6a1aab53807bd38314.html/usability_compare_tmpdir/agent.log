INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

However, there are significant usability issues that make it challenging to accomplish the website\'s high-level goal of booking specialized cleaning services. \n\n1. **Service Selection**: The dropdown menu for selecting services is limited to broad categories, and there is no clear way to specify additional specialized services like "Leather Cleaning" or "Upholstery Care."\n\n2. **Date Selection**: The date input field does not function as expected. Clicking the field does not bring up a date picker, and there is no alternative way to input a date, leading to an error message when attempting to confirm a booking.\n\n3. **Feedback and Errors**: The lack of clear feedback or guidance when actions do not work as expected (e.g., non-functional buttons or fields) makes it difficult to understand what steps to take next or how to resolve issues.\n\n4. **Booking Process**: Attempts to confirm a booking did not proceed past the initial step, indicating potential issues with the backend process or form validation.\n\nOverall, while the website\'s design is simple, its usability is hindered by non-functional elements and a lack of intuitive interaction paths, which could frustrate users trying to book specialized services.'}
