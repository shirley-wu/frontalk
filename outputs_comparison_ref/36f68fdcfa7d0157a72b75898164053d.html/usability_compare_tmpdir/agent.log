INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

These are critical components for users looking to engage with the practice and assess its offerings.\n\n3. **Navigation and Interaction**: While navigating between sections is intuitive, the lack of feedback or error messages when interactions fail (e.g., date picker not appearing) can be confusing for users.\n\nIn summary, while the website has a simple and user-friendly design, its effectiveness is compromised by incomplete functionality and placeholder content. To improve usability, it would be beneficial to ensure all interactive elements are fully operational and provide real content for users to engage with.'}
