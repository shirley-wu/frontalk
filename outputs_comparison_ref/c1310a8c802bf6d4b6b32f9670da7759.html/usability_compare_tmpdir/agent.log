INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'During my exploration of the University of New Hampshire Academic Repository, I found several key usability aspects:\n\n1. **Navigation and Search Functionality**: The homepage provides a clear structure with sections like "Advanced Search," "Research Highlights," "Trending Authors," and "Featured Collections." However, the "Advanced Search" did not yield any results, indicating potential issues with search functionality or a lack of feedback when no results are found.\n\n2. **Content Access**: Downloading a PDF of an article worked smoothly, suggesting that accessing full-text articles is user-friendly. However, the related articles section failed to load content, which is a significant usability issue as it prevents users from exploring related research easily.\n\n3. **Interactivity**: Attempting to leave a comment did not result in any visible change, suggesting that this feature might not be functioning properly. This limits user engagement and interaction with the content.\n\n4. **Exploration of Authors**: The "Trending Authors" section effectively lists authors and their publications, providing an easy way to explore works by prominent authors. Clicking on an author led to a detailed view, which is a positive aspect for users seeking comprehensive information about specific researchers.\n\nOverall, while the website offers a straightforward interface and some functional features like PDF downloads, several critical issues such as broken links in related articles, non-functional search, and comment sections significantly impact its usability. Improvements in these areas would enhance the user experience by enabling more effective exploration and interaction with academic content.'}
