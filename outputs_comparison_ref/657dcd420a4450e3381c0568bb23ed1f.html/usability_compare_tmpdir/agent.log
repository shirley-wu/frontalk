INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Summary: The "What\'s with the Climate?" website offers a variety of sections dedicated to different aspects of climate change and environmental governance. The navigation is straightforward, with clear labels leading to areas such as Climate News, Action Trackers, Policy Watch, and more. The site provides a mix of interactive elements and downloadable content, such as PDFs for in-depth information on specific topics.\n\nUsability Observations:\n1. **Navigation**: The main menu is easy to understand, allowing users to explore different sections without confusion.\n2. **Content Access**: While the site offers detailed insights, much of the in-depth content is accessible only through PDF downloads, which may not be the most user-friendly format for quick browsing.\n3. **Interactive Features**: The Expert Q&A and Community Forum sections suggest user interaction, but the lack of immediate feedback or visible interaction options (e.g., posting new comments directly) might limit user engagement.\n4. **Design**: The design is simple and functional, focusing on content delivery rather than visual appeal. This might be suitable for users seeking information but may not engage those looking for a more dynamic experience.\n\nOverall, the website serves its purpose by providing information and updates on climate change, but it could enhance usability by integrating more interactive and immediate content access features.'}
