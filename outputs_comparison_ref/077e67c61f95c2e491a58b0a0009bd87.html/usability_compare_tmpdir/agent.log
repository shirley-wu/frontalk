INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

This could frustrate users trying to narrow down their options.\n\n2. **Customization Feature**: While the site offers a "Customize Your Jewelry" feature, the lack of feedback or next steps after selecting options and entering engraving text makes it unclear how to proceed with the customization.\n\n3. **Virtual Try-On**: The virtual try-on feature appears to be non-functional, with no visible changes or interactions available after clicking on the buttons provided. This could disappoint users expecting an interactive experience.\n\n4. **Educational Content**: The "Jewelry Education Hub" provides basic information but lacks depth or interactive content that could engage users further.\n\n5. **Gift Guide**: This section is straightforward, listing jewelry options for different occasions, which can be helpful for users seeking gift ideas.\n\nOverall, while the website has a variety of features aimed at enhancing the shopping experience, the lack of functionality and feedback in critical areas significantly impacts usability. Improvements in these areas could enhance user engagement and satisfaction.'}
