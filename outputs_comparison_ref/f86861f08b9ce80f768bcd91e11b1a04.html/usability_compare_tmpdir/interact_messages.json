Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page \u2014 including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change \u2014 you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first \u2014 just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons \u2014 do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first \u2014 just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"

This made it difficult to access detailed information about specific golf clubs.\n\n2. **Search and Filtering**: The search input field on the \"Club Directory\" page did not filter results as anticipated. Similarly, the event filtering on the \"Events\" page did not update the displayed events, indicating a potential issue with interactive elements.\n\n3. **Input Fields**: On the \"Membership & Booking\" page, the input fields for booking a tee time were not clearly labeled or intuitive, leading to confusion and incorrect data entry. The lack of clear labels for date and time fields made it challenging to perform tasks accurately.\n\n4. **Interactivity**: Buttons like \"Add to Calendar\" and \"Book Tee Time\" did not produce any visible actions or confirmations, which can hinder user confidence in the site's functionality.\n\nOverall, the website's usability could be improved by ensuring that navigation buttons are functional, search and filter options work as expected, input fields are clearly labeled, and interactive elements provide feedback to the user. These improvements would enhance the user experience and make the site more intuitive for first-time users."
