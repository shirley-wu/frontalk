INFO - {'role': 'system', 'content': "Your task is to evaluate the **usability** of a website. You will simulate a **first-time user**: you are given only the website's high-level goal without detailed instructions. Your task is to extensively explore the website, infer what you want to accomplish as an end user, attempt the tasks, and judge how easy it is to learn and use the site to complete them.\n\nAt each step, I will provide you with:\n1. An annotated screenshot - with **numerical labels** placed in the **top-left corner** of each web element.\n2. A simplified **textual representation** of the page — including the tag names and texts for every element annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAt each step, you can choose one of the following valid action formats:\n\n### Valid Actions\n\nAction should **STRICTLY** follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Hover [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Input_Text]\n- Select [Numerical_Label]; [Option_Text]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- GoBack\n- Upload [Numerical_Label]; [Filename]\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. Execute only one action per iteration.\n2. **Avoid repeating** the same action if the page does not change — you may have chosen the wrong element or label.\n3. To input text, you do **not** need to click the textbox first — just use the `Type` action. Pressing `ENTER` is handled automatically. However, you may still need to click a search button afterward to apply a filter.\n4. Clearly distinguish between textboxes and buttons — do **not** type into a button. If no textbox is visible, consider clicking a search button to reveal it.\n5. To upload a file, you do **not** need to click the upload button first — just use the `Upload` action and specify the filename. The filename **MUST** be chosen from: `placeholder.png`, `placeholder.mp4`, `placeholder.mp3`, or `placeholder.pdf`. \n6. The website uses placeholder for data and media (images, videos, audio, PDFs).\n\n### Your Reply Format\n\nThought: {Describe image content, then perform step-by-step reasoning}\nAction: {One properly formatted action}"}

INFO - {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "The website presents a basic structure for managing and creating content, likely aimed at users who want to build and manage their own websites. However, the usability of the site is hindered by several factors:\n\n1. **Lack of Feedback and Interactivity**: Many of the interactive elements, such as the tool icons in the website builder section and the post management options, did not produce any visible changes or feedback when clicked. This lack of response can be confusing for first-time users who are trying to explore and understand the platform's capabilities.\n\n2. **Limited Navigation and Guidance**: The website does not provide clear guidance or tooltips to help users understand how to use the available features effectively. This makes it difficult for new users to navigate the site and utilize its functionalities without prior experience or additional support.\n\n3. **Static Representation**: The static nature of the current representation means that users cannot fully experience the dynamic aspects of website building or content management, such as drag-and-drop interfaces or real-time updates in the content preview section.\n\nOverall, the platform needs to enhance interactivity, provide better user guidance, and ensure that actions lead to expected outcomes to improve usability for first-time users."}
